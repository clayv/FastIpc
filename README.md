# FastIpc
### A very fast interprocess communication library using memory mapped files.

This code is **strongly** based (only minor changes were made) on the talk Joe Albahari gave at NDC Sydney in August 2017 (see video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLX1sYVf-Xg).

This puts the code Joe demonstrated (which was shown in LinqPad) into all the appropriate class files and demonstrates using low-level programming with pointers, memory mapped files, and lock-free synchronization.
